# Dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles for both Linux and macOS. I highly recommend to look through the dotfiles and use what you find interesting, instead of installing the entire config. If you however want to install the config, see section about installation.

## Installation

### Full

To setup the entire configuration, run the installation script with `sudo -u <user> ./install.sh`. This will install a bunch of things and setup the shell, neovim and etc...
